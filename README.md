# LearnPythonTheHardWay
Exercise examples done as part of the lessons from the online book Learn Python The Hard Way.

I am using this book to learn the uses, and the syntax of Python, as I have mainly only used C++ before now.
Once I have this book completed I will move onto creating my own applications and websites.
